# Drumagio

Another Arduino electronic drum kit.
This time, with a simple and easy to use reactive web interface. 

Complete with almost realtime graphs of the signal.

Each analog input has an on/off switch, floor and ceiling thresholds, plus a dropdown menu to select instruments.

Made with love and passion for music, culture and creativity.
